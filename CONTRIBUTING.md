# Contributing to Inevitable

 As a contributor, here are the guidelines I would like you to follow:

 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests only.
If you would like to chat about a question in real-time, you can reach out via [discord project server][discord].

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help by
submitting an issue. Even better, you can
submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by submitting an issue to the GitHub
Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that I can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
discussed. This will also allow me to better coordinate the efforts, prevent duplication of work,
and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request
